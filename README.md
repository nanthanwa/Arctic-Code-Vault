*Dear all men and aliens from the future,\
\
My name is Thanwa Jindarattana (My old surname is Nooploy).\
You can also call me Nan.\
I was here, Earth (Bangkok, Thailand).\
You can contact me if you are interested (and yeah if I'm still alive).\
I prefer Thai over other languages if you speak it too (I can read English as well).\
\
By the way, I also attached my picture below if you would like to see it.\
This place called Krua Chukka Done (Thai restaurant) at Mae Klong Riverside in Kanchanaburi.\
The mountain and the river are really beautiful. I love nature.
\
Warm regards,\
Thanwa Jindarattana\
